# Q400-Performance-Calculator
A quick and dirty performance calculator I made for the Majestic Q400 addon given their Takeoff Speeds Card.

Feel free to submit an issue or a pull request if you see problems with the code.

These performance metrics were given by Majestic Software for their Q400 flight simulator addon.
